## General info
Interfacing Python and Traci with a simulation in Sumo (Simulator of Urban Mobility), in order to obtain some measures of the network.

## Technologies used
Python3 - https://www.python.org/  <br/>
Sumo 1.14.1 - https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/index.html <br/>
Traci 1.14.1 - https://pypi.org/project/traci/ <br/>

## Setup
Right now the working programs are tested in the oldNetwork simulation for Sumo.
If you want to run the program and see the output you need to install well all the Technologies. <br/>
After that you will able to test the enviroment in that way : https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/TraCI/Interfacing_TraCI_from_Python.html
